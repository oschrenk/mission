# Obsidian

## Core

Obsidian, as is, only offers very rudimentary task management in the form of [task lists](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax#Task+lists)

To create a task list, start each list item with a hyphen and space followed by `[ ]`

- [x] This is a completed task.
- [ ] This is an incomplete task.

You can use any character inside the brackets to mark it as complete.

- [x] Milk
- [?] Eggs
- [-] Eggs

It is up to plugins and themes to extend the idea of what a task is. In particular

- any character marks it as complete
- there is no idea of start, due, scheduled, created dates
- there is no idea of moved, or cancelled status
